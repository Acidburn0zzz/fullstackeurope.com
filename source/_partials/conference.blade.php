    <p class="leading-looser mb-8">
        Full Stack Europe is the international conference for developers who want to learn across the stack. Step out of your comfort zone and improve not only your existing skills, but learn new ones as well. Do you identify as full stack or are interested in front end, back end, devops, design or anything in between? This is the conference for you!
    </p>

    <p class="leading-looser mb-8">
        Full Stack Europe is a two day conference with an extra day of workshops. There’s a mix of short 30 minute talks and longer keynotes, giving you insights in a wide range of topics. The breaks give you ample time to mingle with fellow full stack developers, speakers, experts, and vendors.
