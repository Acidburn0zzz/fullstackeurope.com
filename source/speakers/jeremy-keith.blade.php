He also made the website <a href="https://huffduffer.com/">Huffduffer</a> to allow people to make podcasts of found soundsâ€”it's like Instapaper for audio files.</p>
    <p>Hailing from Erin's green shores, Jeremy maintains his link to Irish traditional music running the community site <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. He also indulges a darker side of his bouzouki-playing in the band <a href="https://saltercane.com/">Salter Cane</a>.</p>
    <p>Jeremy spends most of his time goofing off on the internet, documenting his time-wasting on <a href="https://adactio.com/">adactio.com</a>, where he has been writing for over fifteen years.</p>
