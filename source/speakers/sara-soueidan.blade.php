    <p>As front-end developers, we are tasked with building the <i>front</i> end of a Web site or application — in other words, we are building the <i>user's</i> end of an interface. This is why it is crucial that we ensure that the front-end foundations that we build are as inclusive of and accessible to as many users as possible. To do that, we must build with accessibility in mind from the get-go. This, in turn, means that the way we approach writing HTML, CSS, SVG and JavaScript <i>might</i> need to change as we take into consideration many factors that affect how (in)accessible our UIs are.</p>

    <p>This talk is a practical one, chock-full of tips for creating more accessible front-end foundations. If writing HTML, CSS, SVG and JavaScript is part of your job, then this talk is for you.</p>

    <p>In this session — a series of macro case studies from real client projects — Sara shares some frustrations, many lessons learned, and a lot of practical tips and tricks for building accessible front-end foundations that you can take and apply in your own projects right away.</p>
