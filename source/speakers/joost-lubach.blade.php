    <p>Having always heard people saying: "Get off your phone, and be social", Joost has made it his personal mission to prove that technology doesn't have to mean that you're always on your phone, but can (and should) engage people socially.</p>

    <p>While freelancing, he's enjoyed having clients in the TV & media industry in The Netherlands. His app <a href="https://twitter.com/kamergotchi">Kamergotchi</a>, a game created for a popular Dutch satirical TV show even hit #1 in the Dutch App Store.</p>

    <p>After ten years of freelancing as an app & full-stack developer, he's now focusing on his two latest brain childs: <a href="https://www.groundcontrol.app">GroundControl</a>, a digital event guide & gamification system, and Blip, a crowdcasting-platform for micropodcasts.</p>

    <p>In addition to developing, he sometimes teaches JavaScript, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> & <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a> at <a href="http://hackyourfuture.be">HackYourFuture</a>, a coding school for refugees, with schools in The Netherlands, Denmark and the UK.</p>
